## Dependencies
Matlab

## Usage
First of all, you need to ensure the correct path. 
Then you can extract features, split dataset, training and testing.

### Extract features
run the SAUDFeatureCompute.m

### split dataset
There are two ways to split a dataset: fixed and random.
fixed:run the fixedSplitTrainTest.m
radom:run the SplitTrainTest.m

### Training
run the SVM.m
### Testing
run demo.m
